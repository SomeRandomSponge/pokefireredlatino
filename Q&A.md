# (Possible) Questions and Answers

***1-Why does this project exist?***


A: I've never been satisfied with the official spanish translations for Pokémon games, 
(tough that's partially because I'm not from Spain, and those translations are pretty much made for Spaniards only), 
to learn how to work with the Pokémon decomp projects, there were no other translations for pokefirered/pokeemerald (that I knew of at the time),
I wanted to try and translate something, and because I had/have free time that I didn't knew how to use.


***2-Which language/version is this translation based on?***


A: Short version: it's a mix of the english version, the official spanish version, the original japanese,
and a name taken from the german version.

Full (probably too long) version:

Most of the dialog is based on the english version, with the official spanish version used as reference 
if my first attempt doesn't fit in the textboxes/if I'm not sure about how to adapt something. 
Tough with some text that was censored outside Japan has two versions; one based on translations of the original japanese, 
and the other one translated from the english version 
(at the time of writing this it only applies to the dialog of the old man that blocks the path in Viridian City).

The names of the Kanto locations are mostly taken from the anime's Latam Spanish dub 
(or from the official spanish games if they didn't appear in the anime), with a notable exception...
Celadon City (translated as Ciudad Azulona in the official spanish version and both spanish dubs of the anime), 
in this translation I changed it to Ciudad Prisma (Prism City), inspired by it's german name (Prismania City). 
To be honest, I did that because I didn't want to repeat colors on the city names and was kinda stubborn about it; 
the color blue was already used for Cerulean City, and green was alredady represented by Viridian City.

Besides, Celadon/Azulona/Prisma is not really related with the color blue, and in the first gen (with SBG colors) is displayed with a greenish tint, 
so Prisma/Prism was the best choice I thought of to fix both of those issues.
(Ah, an as a last detail, a prism can be an object which is able to turn withe light into a RAINBOW...
RAINBOW like some thing that you can win in this city).


Move names are a mix of the ones used in the anime's Latam spanish dub, the ones on the official spanish games, 
some translated more directly from japanese, tough some adapted to fit within the text limits.
For the moves that have changed names in the Latam spanish dub of the anime, most time I just chose what seemed the best to me.

The names for trainer classes are mostly the ones already in the official spanish games, or a translation of the english names.


***3-And why don't you translate from japanese directly?***


A: Because I don't know enough japanese :(. My knowledge of the language is nowhere near good enough to be able to translate a game, 
and it's even worse for a game with so much text like a Pokémon one.


***4-How can I contact you if I want to report an error? ***


A: You can contact me on Discord, as RandomSponge77#0458.


***5-Can I use pokefireredlatatino for my own project?***


A: Of course! just remember to give credit to me and the people in [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md)


***6-Is the missing stuff going to be translated as well?***


A: Yes! at the date of writing this I'm somewhat close to finishing (story-wise) so hopefully it doesn't take too long.


***7-Are they going to be more alternate versions, like the uncensored stuff?***


A: As of right now i have a few plans, (one related to Gen 1 weirdness that was kept in these remakes) but nothing concrete yet.


***8-Is it possible to port pokefireredlatino to a binary hack/RPG Maker game/another platform?*** 


A: It *is* possible, tough it would probably be tedious to do so on a binary hack. I'm not going to do it, 
tough if anyone wants to try they can, just remember to give credit as mencioned on the fifth question.


***9-Do you plan to translate pokeemerald?***


A: Yes, but only when the project is finished or very close to being finished (tough i won't touch pokeruby).
I'm also thinking on doing something similar with when its disassembly/decompilation gets easier to edit,   
and it will probably take a while to get there. And with HeartGold done it wouldn't be *that* hard to translate Diamond/Platinum, 
but there's a lot to be done before i get there.


***10-Are you going to translate any Pokémon games (post-gen 4)?***


A: Not really, not only because I'm not that interested in those games, they're also somewhat limited in what you can edit, 
as far as i remember.
Maybe I'll reconsider if I don't get totally tired after doing the gen 4 games.


***11-Are you going to translate any Pokémon games (pre-gen 3)?***

A: No, mostly because the first 2 generations are much more limited about how much text you can fit on the screen, 
on top of just being limited by the Gameboy/Gameboy Color, and the remakes are basically superior in almost every way.
At most, I may try something with pokecrystal because I enjoy hacks like Polished Crystal a lot and I would like to have them in spanish,
but I'm not using pokered or pokeyellow anytime soon.










***12-Why didn't you just port the text and graphics from the official spanish version?***


A: Read the answer to question 1 again.
 
 
~~Besides, theres no other way to extract or get the text from the official version aside from the ROM itself (that i knew of), 
and i didn't want to use binary hacking tools for this lol.
